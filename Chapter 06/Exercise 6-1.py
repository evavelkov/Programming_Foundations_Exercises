# Programming Exercise 6-1: File Reading - Display Contents
#
# Task: Write a program that reads and displays the entire contents of a file.
print("hello")
# Requirements:
# 1. Create a main function that handles file operations
# 2. Open the 'numbers.txt' file for reading
# 3. Read the entire file contents at once
# 4. Display the contents to the console
# 5. Properly close the file
#
# Functions:
# - main(): handles file opening, reading, and display
#
# Logic:
# - Declare a variable to store file contents
# - Open 'numbers.txt' file in read mode
# - Use read() method to get all file contents
# - Close the file
# - Print the contents to console
#
# File Operations:
# - open('numbers.txt', 'r') - opens file for reading
# - infile.read() - reads entire file content
# - infile.close() - closes the file
#
# Example:
# (Displays all contents of numbers.txt file)
#
# Note: This program assumes 'numbers.txt' exists in the same directory
